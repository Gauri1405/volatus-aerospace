      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for all main text elements, including headings, project titles, and navigation text on light backgrounds. The 'secondary' color serves as the base background, providing a clean and spacious canvas. The 'secondaryForeground' color is used for text on the 'secondary' background, ensuring high readability. The 'footerBackground' custom color is reserved for footer backgrounds, creating a warm, grounded contrast to the white page backgrounds. Text and links within the footer should use 'primaryForeground' to maintain legibility. This palette supports a high-contrast, elegant look with minimal color distractions, emphasizing typography and layout. Avoid using colors from content images to maintain brand consistency and clarity.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' black (#000000) on 'secondary' white (#FFFFFF) background achieves excellent WCAG AAA contrast ratios for all text sizes, ensuring maximum readability. The 'primaryForeground' white (#FFFFFF) on 'footerBackground' (#7A6F4E) provides sufficient contrast to meet WCAG AA standards for body text and links. The palette's high contrast between text and backgrounds supports accessibility and legibility across devices and lighting conditions."
